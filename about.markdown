I am a Research Engineer in the Decision Lab, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur, India. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering and a Master's degree in Biological Sciences and Bioengineering from IIT Kanpur. I am interested in learning about decision-making and how it gets affected by the anxiety and depression levels of individuals.
